## Running the program

Open a terminal for the server and a terminal for the client. 

In the server terminal use the command: go run \[path to server.go\] [number]

In the client terminal use the command: go run \[path to client.go\]

Once connection is established you can now enter text lines in the client terminal that will be received and returned by the server.
